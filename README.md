# Cryptography, Encryption and Translation
## A Middle Circle 3.0 Presentation

Presentation on Cryptography and Encryption, as lectured by [me](https://github.com/alastairparagas) and [Alberto Mizrahi](https://github.com/albertomizrahi) for the FIU Honors Middle Circle 3.0 Class. This will deal with topics such as ciphers, modern security systems, TOR (The Onion Router), modern examples such as the MyHonors portal and many more.

## Khan Academy
Khan Academy's [Journey into Cryptography](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography) section is a great resource to learn about cryptography and encryption. Highly recommended.
